# data-gang

## Objective: 

You have the following options. Whatever you choose you must make use of JOIN queries and provide a way to authenticate users.

Most prescriptive: build a platform for writing and sharing reviews of coding resources. User stories:

- I can log in.
- I can see a list of recent reviews.
- I can see a list of reviewed resources.
- I can create, edit and view my own reviews.
- I can see a list of reviews of a particular resource.
- I can click on a listed review to read it.
- (optional extra) I can see a list of reviews by a particular user.

Focus on getting this functionality rather than making the frontend look good. Build your endpoints first.

Less prescriptive: a review site for any kind of media. Same user stories.

Least prescriptive: anything!
